Assessment Overview

This assignment requires teams to develop a database application using agile development principles, with Scrum as the adopted methodology.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Propose and defend innovative solutions to software development and associated business problems using agile strategies.

Discover challenges in adopting agile strategies within database application development.

Apply proven agile database techniques for fast, high-quality development.

Demonstrate academic progression and career development skills.

Team Composition & Marking Structure

Group project (3-5 members per team).

80% of the mark is allocated for team submission.

20% of the mark is allocated for a personal statement.

Individual contribution is assessed; insufficient contribution will reduce the final grade.

Project Requirements

Develop a database-driven business system that effectively implements agile software development methodologies. Key deliverables include:

Functional prototype with a business-use focus.

Comprehensive project documentation.

Evidence of Scrum adoption and agile project management.

Reflective review and personal statements.

Failure to document system functionality will result in it not being considered during grading.

Scenario: Emergency Water Bowser Management System

Teams will develop an information system for UK water companies to assist in deploying and managing emergency water bowsers. The system should enable:

Planning emergency bowser locations.

Scheduling and monitoring deployment.

Tracking maintenance requests and mechanical issues.

Planning and monitoring refilling schedules.

Notifying the public about bowser locations and statuses.

A fully functional prototype will be demonstrated at a trade show (assignment deadline).

Key System Features:

Assist in planning and recording bowser locations.

Manage deployment, tracking, and maintenance.

Schedule refilling and monitor supply levels.

Notify consumers and stakeholders of bowser statuses.

Allow users to report problems and track resolutions.

Considerations for Development:

Bowser ownership and borrowing (UK Government Mutual Aid Scheme).

Emergency water supply priorities (domestic, healthcare, emergency services, critical industries).

Tracking and coordinating refilling, repairs, and deployment logistics.

Managing invoices and financial reconciliation.
